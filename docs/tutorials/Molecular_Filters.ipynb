    "# ### Using the filter module\n",
    "\n",
    "# The filter module provides a variety of two types of filters:\n",
    "# -  `generic`: custom filtering based on some given molecule properties such as number of atoms, presence of specific atom type, etc\n",
    "# -  `lead`: filtering based on structural motifs that are known to either be toxic, reactive, unstable or frequent false positive\n",
    "\n",
    "# # common filters including pains, brenk, nih, zinc\n",
    "# pains_a = rdfiltercatalog.FilterCatalogParams.FilterCatalogs.PAINS_A\n",
    "# lead.catalog_filter(smiles_list, [\"nih\", pains_a, NamedCatalogs.dundee()])\n",
    "\n",
    "# # filtering based on some commons alerts + additional lead like rules\n",
    "# lead.alert_filter(smiles_list, alerts=[\"Glaxo\", \"BMS\"], rule_dict=dict(MW=[0, 100]))\n",
    "\n",
    "# # filtering based on NIBR screening deck process described in\n",
    "# # \"Evolution of Novartis' small molecule screening deck design\" by Schuffenhauer, A. et al. J. Med. Chem. (2020),\n",
    "# # https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01332.\n",

    "# ### Advanced options\n",
    "\n",
    "# The advanced options allow a better control over the filtering process. They also provide more information on the issues with the molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "# #### AlertFilters\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# #### NovartisFilter\n",
    "\n",
    "# These are the underlying filters called by `lead.screening_filter`. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Here is an explanation of the output:\n",
    "# - **status**: one of `[\"Exclude\", \"Flag\", \"Annotations\", \"Ok\"]` (ordered by quality). Generally, you can keep anything without the \"Exclude\" label, as long as you also apply a maximum severity score for compounds that collects too many flags.\n",
    "# - **covalent**: number of potentially covalent motifs contained in the compound\n",
    "# - **severity**: how severe are the issues with the molecules:\n",
    "#       - `0`: compound has no flags, might have annotations;\n",
    "#       - `1-9`:  number of flags the compound raises;\n",
    "#       - `>= 10`:  default exclusion criterion used in the paper\n",
    "# - **special_mol**: whether the compound/parts of the compound belongs to a special class of molecules (e.g peptides, glycosides, fatty acid). In that case, you should review the rejection reasons.\n",

    "# filter_obj = NovartisFilters()\n",
    "# out = filter_obj(smiles_list)\n",
    "# out\n",
    "\n",
    "# #### Demerits scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "# Demerit scoring uses the Eli Lilly filter rules. Those are complex rules, that can be customized in any way you wish. \n",
    "\n",
    "# The following \"information\" will be computed and added as columns to a DataFrame for each run:\n",
    "\n",
    "# - **status**: this was added for compatibility and has values `\"Exclude\"`, `\"Flag\"` or `\"Ok\"`.\n",
    "# - **rejected** : whether the molecule pass the filter or was rejected\n",
    "# - **reasons**: the reasons why the molecule was rejected if available\n",
    "# - **demerit_score** a demerit score for molecules. The lower the better. A cutoff is used to reject molecule with too many demerits, which you can refilter again after.\n",
    "# - **step**: step of the pipeline where molecule was filtered out, if available\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# out = score(smiles_list, **test_config)\n",
    "# out\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Although the demirits.score is already quite fast, you can also call the parallelized version of it using the `batch_score` function\n",
    "\n",
    "# out2 = batch_score(smiles_list, n_jobs=2,  batch_size=100,  progress=True, **test_config)\n",
    "# out2\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### PhysChem Rule application\n",
    "\n",
    "# You can also apply a set of physchem rules to a list of compounds\n",
    "\n",
    "# You can apply the basic rules independently\n",
    "\n",
    "# from medchem.rules.basic_rules import rule_of_five, rule_of_three, rule_of_leadlike_soft\n",

    "\n",
    "# RuleFilters.list_available_rules()\n",

    "\n",

    "# You can also apply the rule filter to a batch of molecules.\n",
